Introduction
=======

pymetro is a wrapper around the `Metro Developer API. <http://developer.metro.net/>`_ Using pymetro you can work
with the API in a Pythonic manner: results are returned as Python objects with support
for the familiar notions of working with data structures.

The Metro Developer API provides access to public transit routes and schedules for
carrier agencies across Southern California.  Please be sure to review and respect the `Metro Developer API Terms and Conditions. <http://developer.metro.net/policies/terms/>`_

Requirements
========

If you are using a version of Python older than 2.5, you need to have ElementTree available.

You will need to sign up at the Metro Developer site for an API key.
